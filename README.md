# Sappy Software License Classificator
## Project Description
Today there exist three primary categories of software licenses:
1. Open Source. Those are the licenses which impose either no or little restrictions on a licensee. Examples: MIT, BSD, Mozilla Public License.
2. Copyleft-like. Licenses of this type forbid the licensee from rights escalation. For instance, you cannot make a project closed-source if it’s under such license. Typical example: GNU GPL.
3. Proprietary. A license for which the software’s publisher or another person retains intellectual property rights usually copyright of the source code, but sometimes patent rights.
In every category, there are hundreds of licenses, each represented as a text file. It would be great to have some way of automatically determining the type and the name of a given license.
The goal of the project is to develop a program that can identify the category and the name of a license given its text representation. 
To get more information please consider peeking into the *Report.pdf* file.
